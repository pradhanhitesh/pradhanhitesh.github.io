# Personal Website (pradhanhitesh.github.io)
Welcome! I am a Research Assistant based in <b>Bengaluru, India</b> and working at <b>Center for Brain Research, IISc</b> on indentifying protective and risk factors associated with dementia.

On weekends, I learn how to code and work on projects. The website is results of one such weekend. However, to make my static GitHub page more interesting I added 5-second loading-delay and interesting neuroscience quotes, and the quote updates everyday (thanks to GitHub actions).

Last fact: Research suggests the human brain consists of about 86 billion neurons. Each neuron forms connections to other neurons, which could add up to 1 quadrillion (1,000 trillion) connections.
