Welcome! I am a Research Assistant based in <b>Bengaluru, India</b> and working at <b>Center for Brain Research, IISc</b> on indentifying protective and risk factors associated with dementia.

On weekends, I learn how to code and work on projects. The website is results of one such weekend. However, to make my static GitHub page more interesting I added 5-second loading-delay and interesting neuroscience quotes, and the quote updates everyday (thanks to GitHub actions).

Last fact: The size of brain areas grows depending on their usage. Indeed, it was found that taxi drivers in London had a brain that was significantly bigger than average.
